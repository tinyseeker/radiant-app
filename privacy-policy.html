    <h1>Privacy Policy for Radiant</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 28, 2025</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Privacy Summary:</strong> Radiant stores all your data locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information on external servers.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Radiant ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the Radiant mobile application (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <li><strong>Activity Data:</strong> Your check-in history, streak count, and progress insights</li>

        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
        <li>Any data on external servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>All data collected by the App is used exclusively on your device to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display your journal entries and vision board</li>
        <li>Track your daily check-in streaks and progress</li>
        <li>Send you local notifications based on your preferences</li>
        <li>Provide personalized affirmations and insights</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Local Storage</h3>
    <p>
        All your data is stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage, a secure local storage system
        provided by React Native. Your data never leaves your device.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Data Security</h3>
    <p>
        Your device's operating system (iOS or Android) provides encryption and security for locally stored data.
        We do not have access to your data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>

    <h3>5.1 Expo Framework</h3>
    <p>
        The App is built using Expo, a framework for React Native apps. Expo does not collect personal data
        unless you explicitly enable analytics features (which we have not enabled).
    </p>

    <h3>5.2 Device Permissions</h3>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To take photos for your vision board (only when you choose to use this feature)</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> To select existing photos for your vision board (only when you choose to use this feature)</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send you daily reminders based on your preferences (only if you enable notifications)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All permissions are optional and only used for the specific features described.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose your data to any third parties.</strong>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, we have no access to it.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

    </ul>

    <p>
        To delete all your data, simply uninstall the App from your device. This will permanently remove
        all locally stored information. We cannot recover this data as we do not have server-side backups.

        <li>Posting a notice in the App (for significant changes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Future Features</h2>
