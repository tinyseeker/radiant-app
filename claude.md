# Claude Development Guidelines for Radiant

## Workflow Process

1. **Think & Plan First**
   - Read the codebase for relevant files
   - Write a plan to tasks/todo.md with a list of todo items

2. **Get Approval**
   - Check in with the user to verify the plan before beginning work

3. **Execute & Track Progress**
   - Work on todo items one by one
   - Mark items as complete as you go
   - Provide high-level explanations of changes at every step

4. **Review & Document**
   - Add a review section to todo.md with:
     - Summary of changes made
     - Any other relevant information

## Core Principles

### Simplicity Above All
- Make every task and code change as simple as possible

- Every change should impact as little code as possible
- Only touch code that is necessary and relevant to the task
- Goal: Do not introduce any bugs

### No Laziness - Senior Developer Standards
