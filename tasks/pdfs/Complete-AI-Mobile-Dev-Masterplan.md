# Part 1: Skills Required for AI Vibe Coding

## The Brutal Truth

**You need 20% traditional programming knowledge to be effective with AI. The other 80% is different skills that most programmers don't have.**

---

## What You DON'T Need (Old Way)

❌ Computer Science degree - Waste of time for app building
❌ Memorizing syntax - AI writes the code
❌ Data structures & algorithms - Rarely matters for apps
❌ Years of practice - You can build real apps in weeks
❌ Deep technical mastery - AI fills the gaps

**The old gatekeeping is dead.**

---

## The 8 Essential Skills (What You DO Need)

### 1. Code Reading & Understanding
**Importance:** 6/10 | **Time to Learn:** 2-4 weeks

**You Need To:**
- ✅ Read code and understand what it's doing
- ✅ Spot obvious bugs or mistakes
- ✅ Understand data flow
- ✅ Know when AI made a mistake

**You DON'T Need To:**
- ❌ Write code from scratch without AI
- ❌ Memorize every function
- ❌ Code on a whiteboard

**How to Learn:**
- freeCodeCamp JavaScript basics (first 30 lessons)
- Read open-source apps with AI explaining parts
- Practice: "AI, explain this code line by line"

---

### 2. Problem Decomposition
**Importance:** 9/10 | **Time to Learn:** 2-3 weeks

**This is the REAL skill.** Breaking big problems into small steps.

**Example:**
❌ **Bad:** "Add social features"

✅ **Good:**
```
Feature: Share affirmation to Instagram

Steps:
1. Add share button next to each affirmation
2. When tapped, create image with:
   - Affirmation text centered
   - Peach background gradient
   - Radiant logo at bottom
3. Open native share sheet

Edge cases:
- Affirmation too long for image?
- Instagram not installed?
```

**How to Learn:**
- Write feature specs before asking AI
- Study Product Requirement Documents
- Ask: "What are ALL the steps?"
- Think through edge cases

---

### 3. Debugging Mindset
**Importance:** 7/10 | **Time to Learn:** 1-2 weeks

**Example:**
❌ **Beginner:** "It's broken, fix it"

✅ **Effective:** "App crashes on ViewJournalScreen. Console shows 'Cannot read property map of undefined'. Happens when journal is empty. Works fine when journal has data."

**How to Learn:**
- Break things on purpose
- Read error messages carefully
- Use console.log strategically
- Google error messages

---

### 4. Basic React Native Concepts
**Importance:** 5/10 | **Time to Learn:** 1 week

**Must Understand:**
- Components (building blocks)
- Props (passing data)
- State (data that changes)
- Navigation (screen flow)
- Styling (appearance)

**After 1 week, you should understand:**
```jsx
<View style={styles.container}>
  <Text>{affirmation}</Text>
  <Button onPress={handleSave} title="Save" />
</View>
```

---

### 5. Product Thinking
**Importance:** 10/10 | **Time to Learn:** 1-2 months

**This separates $0 apps from $10K/month apps.**

❌ **Feature thinking:** "Add dark mode because other apps have it"

✅ **Product thinking:** "Users journal at night. Dark mode reduces eye strain and increases evening usage by 40%. Priority: High."

**How to Learn:**
- Read "The Mom Test"
- Read "Hooked"
- Study top apps in your category
- Talk to real users weekly

---

### 6. UX Intuition
**Importance:** 8/10 | **Time to Learn:** 2-3 weeks

**How to Learn:**
- Use 50+ apps, note what feels good
- Read "Don't Make Me Think"
- Watch real users use your app
- Study Stripe, Linear, Notion

---

### 7. AI Collaboration
**Importance:** 8/10 | **Time to Learn:** 1-2 weeks

✅ **Good prompts:**
- Clear, specific requirements
- Examples of desired behavior
- Edge cases mentioned
- Context about existing code

❌ **Bad prompts:**
- "Make it better"
- "Add features"
- "Fix the bug" (no details)

---

### 8. Business & Marketing
**Importance:** 10/10 | **Time to Learn:** 1+ month

**Harsh Truth:**
- Mediocre app + great marketing = $10K/month
- Amazing app + no marketing = $0/month

**You Need To:**
- Validate ideas with real people
- Understand monetization models
- Write compelling copy
- Build in public
- Master App Store Optimization
- Talk to users and iterate

# Part 4: Product Validation Checklist

## Before Writing Any Code

### Step 1: Identify the Problem (1-2 hours)

**Questions to Answer:**

- [ ] What specific problem am I solving?
- [ ] Who has this problem?
- [ ] How are they solving it today?
- [ ] Why are current solutions inadequate?
- [ ] Is this MY problem too? (Best if yes)

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ "Everyone could use this"
- ❌ "No one else is doing this" (maybe for good reason)
- ❌ "It would be cool if..."
- ❌ Can't name 5 people with this problem

**Green Lights:**
- ✅ You personally experience this pain
- ✅ Can name 10+ people with this problem
- ✅ People are paying for inadequate solutions
- ✅ Clear, specific use case

---

### Step 2: Talk to Real People (3-5 hours)

**The Mom Test Rules:**
1. Talk about their life, not your idea
2. Ask about specifics, not hypotheticals
3. Listen more than talk

**Good Questions:**
- "Tell me about the last time you [related activity]"
- "What's the hardest part about [problem area]?"
- "How are you dealing with that now?"
- "How much does that cost/how much time does it take?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand..."

**Bad Questions:**
- ❌ "Would you use an app that...?"
- ❌ "Do you think this is a good idea?"
- ❌ "How much would you pay for this?" (too early)

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Talked to 20+ people in target audience
- [ ] At least 50% say this is a "hair on fire" problem
- [ ] They're currently paying (time or money) for solutions
- [ ] They get excited when you describe it
- [ ] They ask "when can I use this?"

---

### Step 3: Study the Competition (2-3 hours)

**Research:**
- [ ] Found 5+ apps solving similar problems
- [ ] Downloaded and used each for 15+ minutes
- [ ] Read 50+ reviews (what do users love/hate?)
- [ ] Noted pricing models
- [ ] Identified gaps/opportunities

**Analysis:**
- What do they do well?
- Where do they frustrate users?
- What's missing?
- Can you do ONE thing 10x better?

**Competitive Advantage:**
- [ ] Identified your unique angle
- [ ] NOT "We do everything they do, but better"
- [ ] IS "We do X specifically for Y people"

**Example:**
- ❌ "Better todo app"
- ✅ "Todo app for ADHD users with time-blindness features"

---

### Step 4: Define Your MVP (1-2 hours)

**The Minimum Viable Product:**

**Core Feature (The ONE thing):**
- [ ] What's the single most important feature?
- [ ] If you could only build ONE thing, what would it be?
- [ ] Can someone get value from JUST this?

**Example for Radiant:**
- Core: Daily affirmations input + view
- NOT core yet: Vision boards, sharing, analytics

**MVP Scope:**
- [ ] Solves the core problem
- [ ] Can be built in 2-4 weeks
- [ ] Can be explained in one sentence
- [ ] Has clear success metric

**One-Sentence Test:**
"[App name] helps [target user] [achieve goal] by [unique method]"

Example: "Radiant helps young professionals stay aligned with their goals by creating a personalized daily journal they actually want to read."

---

### Step 5: Pricing Validation (1-2 hours)

**Before building, test pricing:**

**Research:**
- [ ] What do competitors charge?
- [ ] What's the "category price" (what users expect)?
- [ ] What can your audience afford?

**Test:**
Create simple landing page with:
- Problem statement
- Solution description
- Pricing (test 2-3 tiers)
- "Sign up for early access" button

**Run traffic:**
- Post on Reddit
- Share on Twitter
- Tell your network
- Spend $50 on ads

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] 100 landing page visitors
- [ ] 5-10% signup rate (5-10 emails)
- [ ] At least 3 people ask "when is this ready?"

**If no one signs up:** Problem isn't painful enough or solution isn't clear.

---

### Step 6: Pre-Launch Validation (Before App Store)

**Once MVP is built:**

**Beta Testing:**
- [ ] 10 people using it for 1 week
- [ ] At least 5 use it 3+ times
- [ ] Collect feedback (what's confusing, what's missing)
- [ ] At least 3 say they'd pay for it

**Key Metrics to Watch:**
- **Activation:** Do they complete setup?
- **Engagement:** Do they use it again tomorrow?
- **Retention:** Still using after 7 days?

**Minimum Viable Traction:**
- [ ] 30% come back next day
- [ ] 20% still active after 7 days
- [ ] 4+ star average rating from testers
- [ ] No critical bugs reported

---

## Validation Frameworks

### The "Would You Pay?" Test

**After 3-5 days of use, ask:**
"We're adding premium features for $5/month. Would you subscribe?"

**Responses:**
- ✅ "Yes, what features?" = Strong signal
- ⚠️ "Maybe, depends on features" = Lukewarm
- ❌ "No, it should be free" = Weak signal

**Need:** At least 30% say "yes" or "maybe"

---

### The "Hair on Fire" Test

**Ask:** "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is [problem]?"

- 1-5: Nice-to-have (hard to monetize)
- 6-7: Annoying (might pay if cheap)
- 8-10: Hair on fire (will pay well)

**Need:** Average score of 7+ from target users

---

### The Time/Money Test

**Ask:** "How much time/money do you spend on this problem monthly?"

- Less than 1 hour / $0 = Weak problem
- 2-5 hours / $10-50 = Moderate problem
- 5+ hours / $50+ = Strong problem

**Need:** People spending significant resources on the problem

---

## Red Flags to Abandon Idea

**Stop if:**
- ❌ Can't find 20 people with this problem
- ❌ No one is paying for current solutions
- ❌ Everyone says "nice idea" but no one gets excited
- ❌ You have to explain the problem (people should already know it)
- ❌ Market is dominated by free solutions
- ❌ You lose interest after 2 weeks

**It's okay to kill bad ideas. Saves months of wasted work.**

---

## Green Lights to Build

**Build if:**
- ✅ 20+ people confirmed the problem
- ✅ At least 10 say they'd pay
- ✅ You're excited after 1 month of research
- ✅ Clear differentiation from competitors
- ✅ Can build MVP in 4 weeks
- ✅ You'd use it yourself

---

# Part 5: AI Collaboration Best Practices

## The Art of Working with AI

**AI is your co-pilot, not autopilot.**

---

## The 5 Levels of AI Prompts

### Level 1: Vague (Ineffective)
❌ "Build a login screen"
❌ "Make it better"
❌ "Add features"

**Result:** Generic code that doesn't fit your needs

---

### Level 2: Basic (Works, but not great)
⚠️ "Create a login screen with email and password fields"

**Result:** Functional but generic, missing edge cases

---

### Level 3: Detailed (Good)
✅ "Create a login screen with:
- Email input (with email validation)
- Password input (with show/hide toggle)
- Login button (disabled until valid inputs)
- Error message display area
- Loading state during login"

**Result:** Functional with basic error handling

---

### Level 4: Contextual (Very Good)
✅ "Create a login screen matching our app's peach/sage design:
- Email input with icon
- Password with show/hide eye icon
- Rounded login button (peach gradient)
- Error messages in red below inputs
- Loading spinner on button when submitting
- Matches existing auth flow in AuthContext.tsx
- Use same validation as signup screen"

**Result:** Fits your app, handles errors, consistent style

---

### Level 5: Comprehensive (Excellent)
✅ "Create a login screen for Radiant app:

**Design:**
- Follow existing design system (peach #FF9A76, sage #8FBC8F)
- Match styles from WelcomeScreen.tsx
- Use existing components where possible

**Functionality:**
- Email and password inputs
- Real-time validation (email format, password min 8 chars)
- Show validation errors below each input
- Login button disabled until both valid
- Loading state during API call
- Error handling for: wrong password, no internet, server error

**Integration:**
- Use AuthContext for login function
- Navigate to HomeScreen on success
- Store user token in AsyncStorage
- Navigate to ForgotPassword screen on 'Forgot password?' link

**Edge Cases:**
- Handle already-logged-in users (redirect)
- Prevent multiple simultaneous login attempts
- Clear errors when user starts typing
- Auto-focus email input on mount

**Testing:**
- Test with: valid credentials, wrong password, invalid email, no internet

Use TypeScript, follow existing code patterns."

**Result:** Production-ready code that fits perfectly

---

```
"Create a settings screen with user preferences"
```

**2. Review & Refine**
```
"Good start. Update it to:
- Match our design system (colors from HomeScreen)
- Add toggle for notifications
- Add theme selector (light/dark)
- Save to AsyncStorage"
```

**3. Polish**
```
"Almost perfect. Small tweaks:
- Notification toggle should check for permissions first
- Add haptic feedback on toggle
- Group settings into sections with headers"
```

**Each iteration gets closer to perfect.**

---

## Common AI Mistakes to Catch

### 1. Outdated Patterns
❌ AI uses old React patterns (class components, componentDidMount)
✅ Ask for: "Use modern React hooks (useState, useEffect)"

### 2. Missing Error Handling
❌ AI assumes happy path (no errors)
✅ Add: "Include error handling for network failures, empty states"

### 3. Hardcoded Values
❌ AI uses placeholder data
✅ Specify: "Use real data from JournalContext, no hardcoded values"

### 4. Over-Engineering
❌ AI creates complex abstractions
✅ Request: "Keep it simple, no unnecessary abstractions"

### 5. Inconsistent Styling
❌ AI invents new styles
✅ Specify: "Match existing design system, reuse components from X screen"

---

## Debugging with AI

### Level 1: Show the Error
```
"Getting this error:
[paste error message]

In file: ViewJournalScreen.tsx
```

### Level 2: Show the Context
```
"Getting this error:
[paste error]

In file: ViewJournalScreen.tsx

Relevant code:
```jsx
[paste problematic code]
```

Happens when: User taps "View Journal" button
```

### Level 3: Show What You've Tried
```
"Getting this error:
[paste error]

Code:
[paste code]

Context: Loading journal data from AsyncStorage

I tried:
1. Adding null check - still crashes
2. Using optional chaining - still crashes
3. Checking if data exists - still crashes

I think the issue is [your hypothesis]
```

**More context = faster, better fix.**

---

## Advanced AI Collaboration

### Teaching AI Your Codebase

**First conversation with AI:**
```
"Here's my app structure:

**Tech Stack:**
- Expo + React Native
- TypeScript
- AsyncStorage for data
- React Navigation

**Key Files:**
- JournalContext.tsx: Global state management
- storage.ts: AsyncStorage wrapper
- All screens in /screens

**Design System:**
- Primary: Peach #FF9A76
- Secondary: Sage #8FBC8F
- Background: #FFF9F5
- Border radius: 12-30px

**Patterns to Follow:**
- Use hooks, not classes
- TypeScript for all files
- Consistent error handling
- Match existing component structure

Got it?
```

**Now AI understands your context.**

---

### Asking for Explanations

**Instead of:**
❌ "What does this do?"

**Try:**
✅ "Explain this code line by line:
```jsx
[paste code]
```

Specifically:
- What is useState doing?
- Why the dependency array in useEffect?
- What does the return function do?"

**Get deeper understanding.**

---

### Learning Through Doing

**Pattern:**
1. "Build feature X"
2. AI builds it
3. "Explain why you did Y this way"
4. AI explains
5. "Show me an alternative approach"
6. Compare and learn

**You're not just getting code, you're learning.**

---

## AI Tool Recommendations

### For Coding:
1. **Claude Code** (what you're using) - Best for full features
2. **Cursor IDE** - AI-first editor, great for quick edits
3. **GitHub Copilot** - Inline suggestions while typing

### For Design:
1. **v0.dev** - Generate UI components from descriptions
2. **Galileo AI** - Design to code
3. **Midjourney** - App icon generation

### For Copy:
1. **Claude** - App descriptions, marketing copy
2. **ChatGPT** - Alternative for copy

---

## The Golden Rules

1. **Be Specific** - More detail = better results
2. **Provide Context** - Share your tech stack, design system, patterns
3. **Iterate** - First draft is rarely perfect
4. **Verify** - Always test AI-generated code
5. **Learn** - Ask AI to explain, don't just copy-paste
6. **Own It** - You're responsible for understanding the code

**AI is a tool, not a replacement for thinking.**

## The Most Important Rule

**SHIP ON DAY 30. NO MATTER WHAT.**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Building Features No One Wants
❌ "Users will love this!"
✅ "10 users specifically asked for this"

### 2. Not Charging Enough
❌ $1/month (too cheap, hard to sustain)
✅ $5-10/month (fair value)

### 3. Ignoring Retention
❌ Focus only on new users
✅ Keep existing users happy (cheaper than acquiring new)

### 4. Giving Up Too Early
❌ Quit after 3 months of slow growth
✅ Most apps take 6-12 months to gain traction

### 5. Not Marketing
❌ "Build it and they will come"
✅ Spend 50% of time on marketing

---

## When to Quit vs Persist

### Quit If:
- ❌ 6 months in, zero paying customers
- ❌ You've lost passion for the problem
- ❌ Users don't engage (1-day retention < 10%)
- ❌ Market is too small (< 10K potential users)
- ❌ Can't differentiate from free alternatives

### Persist If:
- ✅ Even small revenue ($100-500/month)
- ✅ Users love it (high retention, good reviews)
- ✅ Growing slowly but steadily
- ✅ Still excited about the problem
- ✅ Clear path to improvement

---

## The Reality Check

**90% of apps make < $500/month**
**5% make $1,000-5,000/month**
**1% make $10,000+/month**

**To be in the top 1%:**
- Solve a real, painful problem
- Exceptional UX
- Effective marketing
- Persistence (12+ months)
- Continuous iteration

**It's hard. But achievable.**

**Your advantages:**
- Starting in 2025 (AI tools)
- Learning from others' mistakes (this guide)
- Already have completed MVP (Radiant)
