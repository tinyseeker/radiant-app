# Radiant App - Monetization Strategy

## Recommended Price Points

### Monthly Subscription
**$4.99 - $7.99**

### Annual Subscription
**$29.99 - $49.99** (save 50-60%)

### Starting Price (Recommended)
- **$4.99/month**
- **$39.99/year**

### Rationale

- Room to increase price as features are added
- Competitive with similar apps (Gratitude, Day One, Headspace Lite)

## What You Need Before Charging

### 1. Proven Retention (Most Critical)

**Target Metrics:**
- 60%+ Day 7 retention
- 40%+ Day 30 retention
- Data from 50-100 real users over 4 weeks

**Why This Matters:**
Without retention data, you're gambling. You need proof people actually use it daily.

### 2. Stronger Onboarding

**Currently Missing:**
- Welcome tutorial explaining the "why" behind each feature
- Guided first journal entry
- Quick setup of first affirmation/vision board image
- Preview of what notifications will look like

**Why This Matters:**
Users need to experience value in first 2 minutes or they'll abandon.

### 3. Clear Value Proposition

**Need to Add:**
- Before/after testimonials (even just from beta users)
- Statistics showing impact ("Users who check in daily report 3x better mood")
- Social proof ("Join 1,000+ people transforming their mindset")

**Why This Matters:**
People need to believe it's worth $5/month vs free alternatives.

### 4. Freemium Model (Recommended over pure paywall)

#### Free Tier Includes:
- 3 affirmations (vs unlimited)
- 5 vision board images total (vs 50)
- Daily check-ins (unlimited - this is the hook)
- Streak tracking (unlimited - creates habit)

#### Premium Tier Unlocks:
- Unlimited affirmations
- Unlimited vision board images (10 per category)
- Custom notification times
- Export journal to PDF
- Dark mode (simple but feels premium)
- Priority support

**Why This Matters:**
Let users fall in love with daily check-ins and streaks (free), then upgrade for more personalization.

### 5. Missing Features for $5/month

**Export/Backup**
- People want to own their data

## Recommended Launch Strategy

### Don't Charge Yet. Instead:

1. **Launch Free Beta with Waitlist**
   - "Join 100 early users"
   - Creates exclusivity and buzz

2. **Add Analytics**
   - Track retention metrics
   - Identify drop-off points

3. **Add Premium Features**
   - Export functionality
   - Achievement system
   - Home screen widget

4. **Analyze Data After 4 Weeks**
   - **If retention is 60%+:** Launch freemium at $4.99/mo
   - **If retention is 40-60%:** Fix drop-off points, iterate
   - **If retention is <40%:** Core loop needs work

### Target Launch Date
**6-8 weeks from now**

### Rationale
Better to launch with 100 happy free users and proven retention than rush to monetize and get poor reviews from confused/frustrated paying customers.
